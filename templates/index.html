        <h1> What is the Effect of Socioeconomic Factors and Race on the Ratio of Men to Women Pursuing STEM Careers Within the NYC Region? </h1>

        <h2> <u> What is the Problem? </u> </h2>
        
        <br>

        <p>There is a huge gender divide in the area of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).
          According to an article linked <a href="https://www.builtbyme.com/statistics-facts-women-in-stem/" target="_blank">here</a>, women make up only 28% of the occupations in STEM fields (while men make up 72%), despite 
          them making up approximately 50% of the labor market in general. There are many factors that could contribute to this statistic, including the 
          ethnicity, economic status, and performance in school of an individual, or in this case, an entire group of individuals. We (the creators) looked at
          the 5 boroughs of New York City, which consists of Manhattan, Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island, and related the test scores of public school students influenced 
          by many factors, including ethnicity, gender, and economic status.
        </p>

        <h3> <u> Racial Inequality in STEM </u> </h3>

        <br>

        <p> Racial Inequality is extremely prevalent in STEM, and it's pitted against Black and Hispanic people. This quote from an article linked
          <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/diversity-in-the-stem-workforce-varies-widely-across-jobs/#:~:text=Hispanics%20and%20blacks%20are%20underrepresented,%25)%20and%20Hispanics%20(7%25)." target="_blank">here</a>
          sums it up pretty well. "Hispanics and Blacks are underrepresented, Asians and Whites are overrepresented in most STEM occupations
          The majority of STEM workers in the U.S. are White (69%), followed by Asians (13%), Blacks (9%) and Hispanics (7%)". The word "overrepresented" means that the ratio of the 
          specified race is disproportionate to its makeup of the general population (Just for reference, as of 2019, 60.1% of Americans are White, 18.5% are Hispanic, 13.4% are Black, and 5.9% are Asian). 
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p> While Blacks and Hispanics make up only a small portion of STEM careers, there
          are some areas in which they are widely represented. For example, about 37% of licensed vocational nurses are either Black or Hispanic,
          and about 27% of health support technicians are the same. In the same token, only 5% of veterinarians, optometrists, and chiropractors are Black or Hispanic. Notice how those last three require doctoral level or professional
          level degrees, and this pattern continues, which brings us to the next point. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4> <u> The Economic Disparity </u></h4>
        
        <br>

        <p> The wealth and income level of citizens can heavily impact the educational attainment and the quality of the education attained 
          by those citizens. It's a simple concept, people who have more money can afford to spend more on education. Not only that, but school 
          district and counties that are more wealthy overall can afford to spend more on education, which in turn can affect the quality of education for every single 
          student in that county. Counties with less spending money for schools don't perform as well as counties with more spending money. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p> Students who live in poverty are the least fortunate when it comes to schooling. 
          Students raised in poverty are victim to many more stressors on average than those who are better off. These stressors can and do impair a lot of areas of life, among those 
          being school. Income level is positively correlated to quality of living as well as good parenting, and children who are in poverty generally
          experience more abuse and mistreatment by their parents than those who are better off, which also hurts performance in school.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p> You may be thinking, "well what does all this have to do with STEM?", this has <i> everything </i> to do with STEM. Educational attainment is tied to the career path of many 
          if not all areas of STEM. Students who aren't exposed to many educational opportunities and/or have a bad experience with it won't get the chance to
